# ♻️ Smart Waste Management System

A **Java Full Stack Web Application** developed using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Hibernate**, **Thymeleaf**, and **MySQL** to simplify municipal waste complaint management.

The system provides a centralized platform where citizens can report roadside garbage by uploading images and GPS location, municipal administrators can assign complaints to sanitation workers, and workers can update complaint statuses until completion.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

The application supports:

- 👤 Citizens reporting waste complaints
- 👨‍💼 Municipal administrators reviewing and assigning complaints
- 👷 Sanitation workers updating complaint progress
- 📍 GPS-based location tracking
- 📷 Image upload for complaint verification
- ✅ Complaint status tracking from submission to completion
